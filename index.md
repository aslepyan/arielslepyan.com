## Welcome

<img src="/pictures/good_small.jpg" width="400" />

My name is Ariel Slepyan, though many people call me Arik for short.

I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins studying electrical and computer engineering (ECE). I got my master's ('21) and bachelor's ('20) in biomedical engineering (BME) with a concentration in biomedical instrumentation and micro/nano technology also from Johns Hopkins.

My research focuses on compressive tactile sensing.

My family is of Russian and Jewish origin, and Russian is my first language (*although today I am more comfortable in english*).
For fun I enjoy playing basketball, and I love going skiing during the winters.
I am also an amateur guitar player and photographer.

If you would like to contact me, please do so at my email address: **aslepya1@jhu.edu**
