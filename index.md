My name is Ariel Slepyan, though many people call me Arik for short.

My family is of Russian and Jewish origin, and Russian is my first language (*although today I am more comfortable in english*).
For fun I enjoy playing basketball, and I love going skiing during the winters.
I am also an amateur guitar player and photographer.
