## Teaching
- PCB Design Class (EN.520.299 PCB Design and Microcontroller Programming) -- During intersession at Hopkins I teach a class on PCB design and microcontroller programming! Here is the synopsis for the class and some pictures. All material was recorded/accessible by a shared online drive. Please contact me if you would like access to the link. 

This course will teach you how to design a PCB (printed circuit board) in KiCAD and how to translate Arduino sketches to (truly micro) microcontrollers like the ATtiny that can be tightly integrated onto a PCB. This course is particularly valuable to engineers who are looking to translate a bulky prototype into a tightly integrated, mass-producible solution. The course will cover all aspects of PCB development, from schematic layout all the way to surface-mount assembly of components and programming. Students will learn the material by completing a project where each student will design, program, and assemble a PCB watch that they will keep after the course is over. The course is introductory and there are no prerequisites except for familiarity with Arduino and general electronics.

Below gif shows the watch's operation, showing the time 2:24. The watch is powered by a coin cell battery, is highly accurate using a standard 32.768kHz watch crystal, and is programmed to stay asleep (using minimal power) unless showing time. From the CR1220 battery the battery life is expected to last 3 years.
