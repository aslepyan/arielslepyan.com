## About Me

My name is Ariel Slepyan, though many people call me Arik for short.

I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins studying electrical and computer engineering (ECE). I got my master's ('21) and bachelor's ('20) in biomedical engineering (BME) with a concentration in biomedical instrumentation, neuroengineering, micro/nano technology, and medical devices also from Johns Hopkins.

I am quite passionate about science research; and you can learn about some of my projects [here](http://arielslepyan.me/Projects), and research interests [here](http://arielslepyan.me/Interests).

My family is of Russian and Jewish origin, and Russian is my first language (*although today I am more comfortable in english*).

For fun I enjoy playing basketball, and I love going skiing during the winters.
I am also an amateur guitar player and photographer.
