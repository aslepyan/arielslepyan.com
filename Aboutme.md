## About Me

My name is Ariel Slepyan, though many people call me Arik for short.

I am a creative biomedical engineer from Johns Hopkins with a concentration in biomedical instrumentation, micro/nano technology, and medical devices.

I am quite passionate about science research; and you can learn about some of my projects [here](http://arielslepyan.me/Projects).

My family is of Russian and Jewish origin, and Russian is my first language (*although today I am more comfortable in english*).

For fun I enjoy playing basketball, and I love going skiing during the winters.
I am also an amateur guitar player and photographer.
